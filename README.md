## Tech Stack
Flutter SDK: 3.19.4

State Management: Provider

HTTP Client: http

Persistence: Hive

## State Management Explanation
We used Provider for managing the global state of the articles and favorites. 
ArticleProvider handles API fetching, local search, and favorites management. 
UI widgets like ArticleCard and HomeScreen use Consumer widgets or Provider.of() 
to respond to state changes and rebuild efficiently

## Known Issues / Limitations

No pagination â€“ all posts are fetched at once.

No offline caching of articles (only favorites are persisted).
